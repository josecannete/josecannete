### Hi there, my name is Jos√© üòÅ

I'm a MSc. in Computer Science student from Chile. I'm currently working on my master's thesis on **Language Models for Spanish** under the supervision of [Felipe Bravo-M√°rquez](https://felipebravom.com/).

I'm the creator of [**BETO**](https://github.com/dccuchile/beto), the first BERT-like language model for Spanish, and [**ALBETO**](https://github.com/dccuchile/lightweight-spanish-language-models), which is a series of ALBERT models for Spanish.

I'm member of the [ReLeLa](https://relela.com/) research group at [DCC UChile](https://dcc.uchile.cl) and my research interests include Artificial Intelligence and how to handle and optimize these systems for production environments.

On my spare time I enjoy from listen to music and learning new things from podcasts or audiobooks.

Please feel free to reach me, my e-mail is in my short bio on the left.
